## A Multigrid Method for Efficiently Training Video Models



### 3. Multigrid Training for Video Models

- Proposed Multigrid Method(提出的多重网格方法)

    the underlying sampling grid that is used to train video models need not be constant during training.
    (在训练过程中，用于训练视频模型的底层采样网络不必是恒定的)

    by varying the sampling grid and the mini-batch size during training
    it is possible to reduce training complexity substantially  while achieving similar accuracy in comparison with the baseline.
    (在训练中 改变采样网络 和 mini-batch的大小，可以大大降低训练的复杂性，同时准确度保持差不多)
